# Readme

Top down view, 2D gameplay

Lyssa's odyssey

Still in development
Only gameplay at the moment (no art/sound/story/menus)

Find your way to the exit. Defend yourself by reflecting foe's projectiles. Projectiles are reused, this is where the game matches the theme ;)

Move character with arrows or wasd keys. Move spirit with mouse.

## 1.Gameplay

- reflect foe's projectile
- life (+points), this can be called an insanity level increasing and not decreasing unless you find specific object to comfort yourself
- timer
- go to the end of the level
- cam follow main character
- 2 controls: 1 for movement + 1 for shield
- fylgja's size decreases when half/quarter of life left ?
- extra life when level complete

- rpg element to improve stat or unlock skills?

### score

#### Pickups

- Red: 1
- Green: 2
- Blue: 5
- Yellow: 10
(- Purple: 25 )

#### Other

=> magic formula involving:

- Pickups
- time
- life count
- foe killed


## 2.Story

- wicked dragon transform everybody into ball character and mad one
- lyssa was protected by fylgja, she was turned into a ball but didn't become totally insane.
- lyssa will try to defeat the dragon
- rescue people ? as annex quest => maybe can access true ending if she managed to rescue everyone
- lyssa has to find objects in order to be able to access last part of the game

## 3.Characters

- character = lyssa = fighter with its spirits, is she insane ?
- Fylgja = name of the spirit in its head

For each level:
- killer animal (some of them move following a pattern)
- final boss = stronger/bigger animal

- spawn foes in spawning boxes (create nest for some foes)

## 4.Levels
- different levels/themes (canyon tuto, countryside, jungle,  snow/ice, volcano)
- flat levels
- tuto for start, then choice between level, must complete them all to unlock last level
- each level has a venue specific difficulty
- a skill for each venue?

Levels can be strange if they come from Lyssa's mind.

add a progression bar for levels

### 4.1.canyon tuto

Fylgja speaks to Lyssa to explain all that (= Lyssa speaks to herself)
1- explain howTo move Lyssa
2- show an ennemy
3- tell to get hit by projectile and explain that life decrease
4- introduce Fylgja, che comes out from her head, show how to move her and tell to use her to protect lyssa's from projectile
5- explain that projectiles are reflected and that lyssa can use that to kill foes

Do a tuto cheat sheet accessible from pause menu and main menu.

### 4.2. Hub

Level or menu?

### 4.3.countryside

- windy area ?
- wall of fences
- sunny, yellow

### 4.4.jungle

- swamp with maelstrom
- wall of trees
- dark, scary

### 4.5.snow/ice

### 4.6.volcano
