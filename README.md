- lyssa will try to defeat the dragon
- lyssa has to find objects in order to be able to access last part of the game

- rescue people ? as annex quest => maybe can access true ending if she managed to rescue everyone


## 3.Characters

- character = lyssa = fighter with its spirits, is she insane?
- Fylgja = name of the spirit in its head

For each level:
- killer animal (some of them move following a pattern)
- final boss = stronger/bigger animal

- spawn foes in spawning boxes (create nest for some foes)?


## 4.Levels
- different levels/themes (canyon tuto, countryside, jungle, snow/ice, volcano)
- flat levels
- mimimap
- tuto for start, then choice between level, must complete them all to unlock last level
- each level has a venue specific difficulty

- a skill for each venue?

Levels can be strange if they come from Lyssa's mind.

### 4.1.canyon tuto

Fylgja speaks to Lyssa to explain all that (= Lyssa speaks to herself)
- 1- explain howTo move Lyssa
- 2- show an ennemy (make player avoid foes)
- 3- tell to get hit by projectile and explain that life decrease
- 4- introduce Fylgja, she comes out from her head, show how to move her and tell to use her to protect lyssa's from projectile
- 5- explain that projectiles are reflected and that lyssa can use that to kill foes

## menu idea

- main menu and lyssa next to buttons (on right?)

- level selection (only for debug, player must enter a code in menu to see it)
- Do a tuto cheat sheet accessible from pause menu and main menu.
