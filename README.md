Only gameplay at the moment (no art/sound/story/menus)

Find your way to the exit. Defend yourself by reflecting foe's projectiles. Projectiles are reused, this is where the game matches the theme ;)

Move character with arrows or wasd keys. Move spirit with mouse.

## gameplay

## story

- wicked dragon transform everybody into ball character and mad one
- lyssa was protected by fylgja, she was turned into a ball but didn't become totally insane.
