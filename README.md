# Readme

Top down view, 2D gameplay

Lyssa's odyssey

Still in development
Only gameplay at the moment (no art/sound/story/menus)

Find your way to the exit. Defend yourself by reflecting foe's projectiles. Projectiles are reused, this is where the game matches the theme ;)

Move character with arrows or wasd keys. Move spirit with mouse.

## gameplay

- reflect foe's projectile
- life (+points), this can be called an insanity level increasing and not decreasing unless you find specific object to comfort yourself
- timer
- go to the end of the level
- cam follow main character
- 2 controls: 1 for movement + 1 for shield
- fylgja's size decreases when half/quarter of life left ?

## story

- wicked dragon transform everybody into ball character and mad one
- lyssa was protected by fylgja, she was turned into a ball but didn't become totally insane.
- lyssa will try to defeat the dragon
- rescue people ? as annex quest => maybe can access true ending if she managed to rescue everyone
- lyssa has to find objects in order to be able to access last part of the game

## Characters

- character = lyssa = fighter with its spirits, is she insane ?
- Fylgja = name of the spirit in its head
- killer rabbits (some of them move following a pattern)
- final boss = veg dragon h throwing (rotten ?) salad

## levels
- different levels
- different themes
- flat levels, ball levels, mixed
- tuto level
- tuto for start, then choice between level, one path for the end

Levels can be strange if they come from  Lyssa's mind. 

### tuto

Fylgja speaks to Lyssa to explain all that (= Lyssa speaks to herself)
1- explain howTo move Lyssa
2- show an ennemy
3- tell to get hit by projectile and explain that life decrease
4- introduce Fylgja, che comes out from her head, show how to move her and tell to use her to protect lyssa's from projectile
5- explain that projectiles are reflected and that lyssa can use that to kill foes

Do a tuto cheat sheet accessible from pause menu and main menu.

## menu idea
- main menu and lyssa next to butons (on right ?)

##TODO

- use overlapping actors
- use state machine
- spawn foes in spawning boxes
- make foes inherit 1 base class
