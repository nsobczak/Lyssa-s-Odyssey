Lyssa's odyssey

Still in development
Only gameplay at the moment (no art/sound/story/menus)

Find your way to the exit. Defend yourself by reflecting foe's projectiles. Projectiles are reused.

Move character with arrows or wasd keys. Move spirit with mouse.


## 1.Gameplay

- reflect foe's projectile
- life (+points), this can be called an insanity level increasing and not decreasing unless you find sanity objects (life) to comfort yourself
- timer
- go to the end of the level
- cam follow main character
- 2 controls: 1 for movement + 1 for shield

- extra life when level complete?
- fylgja's size decreases when half/quarter of life left?
- rpg element to improve stat or unlock skills?

### score pickups

- Red: 1
- Green: 2

## 2.Story

- wicked dragon Ashe transform everybody into ball character and mad one
- lyssa was protected by fylgja, she was turned into a ball but didn't become totally insane.
- lyssa will try to defeat the dragon
- lyssa has to find objects in order to be able to access last part of the game

- rescue people ? as annex quest => maybe can access true ending if she managed to rescue everyone


## 3.Characters

- character = lyssa = fighter with its spirits, is she insane?
- Fylgja = name of the spirit in its head

For each level:
- killer animal (some of them move following a pattern)
- final boss = stronger/bigger animal

- spawn foes in spawning boxes (create nest for some foes)?


## 4.Levels
- different levels/themes (canyon tuto, countryside, jungle, snow/ice, volcano)
- flat levels
- mimimap
- tuto for start, then choice between level, must complete them all to unlock last level
- each level has a venue specific difficulty

- a skill for each venue?

Levels can be strange if they come from Lyssa's mind.

### 4.1.canyon tuto

Fylgja speaks to Lyssa to explain all that (= Lyssa speaks to herself)
- 1- explain howTo move Lyssa
- 2- show an ennemy (make player avoid foes)
- 3- tell to get hit by projectile and explain that life decrease
- 4- introduce Fylgja, she comes out from her head, show how to move her and tell to use her to protect lyssa's from projectile
- 5- explain that projectiles are reflected and that lyssa can use that to kill foes
